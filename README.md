## About The Project

Every time you go to see your doctor the wait is unbelievably long and you are stuck filling out the same information every visit. Sitting around other possible sick patients for hours on end.

This app allows you to store your medical information, prescriptions, schedule appointments, and best of all create and scan QR Codes. Allowing you to scan the prescriptions that your doctor has sent for you. If your local Pharmacy does not have QR codes to scan not to worry we have the FDA API who has information on most approved drugs dating back to 1939. Just search up the name of your medically acquired drug and you will receive information on side effects, product labeling, and more.
